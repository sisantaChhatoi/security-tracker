Urban security management lacks transparency, coordination, and real-time oversight.
Authorities, businesses, and communities struggle with tracking security guards, verifying
their backgrounds, ensuring proper deployments, and responding to incidents efficiently.
There is no unified system that allows real-time monitoring, automated attendance, and
structured verification of security personnel.
Your task is to build a full-stack web application that integrates security guard tracking, duty
history management, and incident reporting to ensure efficient security deployment and
oversight in an area.
🔑 Core Features
1. Security Guard Database 📋 – Maintain structured records of all security personnel,
including personal details, past work history, residence, and current deployment.
2. Live Guard Location Tracking 📍 – Track on-duty security guards in real-time using
GPS integration (Geolocation API) and display their locations on an interactive map.
3. Real-Time Guard Movement Tracking – Show actual movement of security guards
on maps with automatic status updates.
4. Multi-Level Access Control (RBAC) – Implement Admin, Police, Society Owners,
and Field Users with different permissions.
5. Duty Assignment & Rotation System 🔄 – Admins can assign and reassign guards
to duty locations
6. Guard Verification & Background Checks ✅ – Police stations, businesses, and
residents can request background verification through an approval system.
7. Shift & Attendance Monitoring ⏳ – Automate check-in/check-out tracking, ensuring
compliance with assigned shifts.
8. Incident Reporting & Quick Response 🚨 – Allow users to report security concerns
(e.g., missing guard, unauthorized absence) and notify the nearest available security
personnel.
9. Guard Performance & Feedback System ⭐ – Businesses and residents can rate
guards based on past performance, helping in future duty assignments.
